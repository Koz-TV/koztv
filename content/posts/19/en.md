I created [an extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chikgakoigfibdfhgfichmgonahfpool?utm_source=item-share-cb) primarily for myself to remove friction. At the same time, Chrome has an extension search, and the extensions themselves are indexed by Google. As a result, this can also serve as an entry point for new users.

It also hooks the audience. If someone installs it, it means the product is genuinely needed by them. It is easier to reach such a user later to remind them of yourself, show an update, or offer early access.

The extension itself is quite simple to make. Claude or Codex can build an extension for your product from just one or two prompts.
