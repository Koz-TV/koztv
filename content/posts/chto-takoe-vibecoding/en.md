Vibe coding – you explain what you want, AI writes the code. That's it.

No syntax, no JavaScript tutorials. Say "make a contact form" – get a form.

## Why this didn't work before

GPT-3 could spit out a function, but building an actual project? No way. It lost context, mixed up files, forgot what it was doing a minute ago.

Now Claude 4.5, GPT-5, Gemini 3 keep the whole project in their head. They understand you even when you explain things badly. They find and fix their own bugs.

Plus real tools showed up: Cursor, Claude Code, Codex. You write what you need – AI edits files – you see results. Whole loop takes seconds.

## Who needs this

Product managers, designers, founders, marketers – anyone who wants to build products but doesn't want to spend three years learning to code.

A PM can build a prototype instead of writing specs. A designer can turn mockups into working sites. A founder can test an idea over the weekend.

## What you can actually build

In a couple hours – landing page, Telegram bot, browser extension, automation script.

Over a weekend – SaaS with auth, tool with a database. That's how I build [chess.rodeo](https://chess.rodeo).

## Where to start

Pick a tool:
- [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) or [Replit](https://replit.com) – everything in browser, nothing to install
- [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) – harder to figure out, but more flexible
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) – popular, but decent work needs a $100+/month plan

More on tools [in a separate post](/posts/about-tools-models-for-vibe-coding/).

Start small. Don't try to build a "Notion killer" right away – make a personal page or a bot that sends weather.

The main thing is learning to explain to AI what you need. It's a skill, comes with practice.

## Limitations

Vibe coding won't make you a programmer. You won't understand what's happening under the hood. For most tasks you don't need to – you need a working product, not server knowledge.

Want to go deeper later? You will. But for getting started it's unnecessary.
