I regularly analyze my games through [chess.rodeo](https://chess.rodeo/)  
And at some point realized I was doing it less often than I’d like.

Not because the analysis is bad, but because the process is a hassle.

Every time it’s the same:  
- open chess.rodeo  
- click sync  
- find the right game  
- start analysis

It doesn't seem complicated, but it’s friction that prevents the habit from forming.  
Instead of analyzing, it’s easier to just start the next game.

As a result, I made a Chrome extension  
that embeds directly into chess.com.  
The game ends – and there’s immediately a button that opens the analysis page.

This turned out to be enough for me to start using the product more often myself.  
Although starting the next game is still more pleasant than digging into the analysis.  
I’ll keep thinking about it.
