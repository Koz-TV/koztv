I help developers and founders ship better products faster.

## Mentorship

One-on-one sessions for developers and product people.

**For developers:** architecture decisions, career growth, code quality, modern tools and practices.

**For founders:** MVP strategy, technical decisions without a CTO, product thinking, when to build vs buy.

Regular or one-time sessions — whatever works for you.

## Contract work

I take on select projects where I can make a real impact:
- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
- MVP development from idea to launch
- Performance optimization and refactoring
- Setting up CI/CD, infrastructure, DevOps

## Code review

Fresh eyes on your codebase:
- Architecture review and recommendations
- Security audit
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Best practices and patterns

## Partnership

Looking for a technical co-founder? I occasionally join projects as a partner when:
- The problem is interesting
- The team is solid
- There's real potential
