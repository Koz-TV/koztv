I help developers and founders ship better products faster.

## Mentorship

One-on-one sessions for founders, product managers, analysts, or anyone looking to build their own product.

MVP strategy, architecture decisions, product thinking, career growth, modern tools and practices — when to build vs buy.

I can also work with your team.

Regular or one-time sessions — whatever works for you.

## Contract work

I take on select projects where I can make a real impact:
- Product consulting and strategy
- Architecture design
- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
- MVP development from idea to launch
- Performance optimization and refactoring
- Setting up CI/CD, infrastructure, DevOps

## Partnership

Looking for a technical co-founder? I occasionally join projects as a partner when:
- The problem is interesting
- The team is solid
- There's real potential
