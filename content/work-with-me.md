I teach people to build real products with AI — no traditional coding required.

## Who it's for

For anyone who wants to build products but doesn't want to spend years learning to code:

- **Product managers** — build prototypes and MVPs yourself
- **Designers** — turn mockups into working products
- **Founders** — launch ideas without hiring developers
- **Marketers** — create landing pages and tools
- **Analysts** — automate workflows and visualize data

## What you'll learn

**Vibe coding with AI:**
- Cursor, Claude Code, Replit Agent — which to choose and how to use
- How to write prompts that make AI produce working code
- How to debug and fix errors without knowing the language

**From idea to production:**
- How to pick the right stack for your project
- How to deploy to a server (yes, it's easier than you think)
- How to set up domains, databases, analytics

**Product thinking:**
- How to decide what to build first
- How to avoid feature creep
- How to launch in a weekend, not six months

## Format

**One-on-one sessions** — 1-2 hour calls, working on your project.

Not lectures — practice. You build, I help. After a few sessions you'll be able to work independently.

One-time or ongoing — whatever works for you.

## Results

- Designer learned to deploy to a server in one session
- Product manager built her first SaaS through vibe coding
- [chess.rodeo](https://chess.rodeo) — my product, 1000+ monthly users

## Also available

**Contract work** — if you need it built, not taught. MVPs, architecture, consulting. I work with individuals and companies (via [KOZDEV LLC](https://kozdev.ru/pages/about/)).

**Partnership** — occasionally join projects as a technical co-founder.
